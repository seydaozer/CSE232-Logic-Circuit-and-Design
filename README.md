# CSE232
My Projects for CSE232 (LOGIC CIRCUIT AND DESIGN)
```
Project 1: This is a game implementation. 
In this game, you use 7 LEDs and two buttons for two players.
The game starts with the led in the middle turned on. 
One user tries to shift the ON led to left while the other tries to push it to right.
The one pushing the button faster wins the game. 

Project 2: Dsigning a machine that can compute the multiplication of two numbers without using multiplier. 
Tihs machine takes two 16-bit numbers and compute the multiplication result of these two numbers.

Final Project: implementation of hangman game machine with Logisim
The word is taken as 64-bit input from the user.
The machine will show the number of characters in the word on 7-segment display.
The user selects a character by pushing a button. If the selected character is absent in the word
a LED (using LED matrix in Logisim) is turned ON. 
It includes scoreboard. The game remember number of times the user and computer won and show that on scoreboard
using 7-segment display.
